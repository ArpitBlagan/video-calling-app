Video Calling App using WebRTC and websocket (ws) ðŸš€

I use single instance of RTCPeerConnection (as a sender and reciver) in frontend
and a simple signaling server.

Run locally

```bash
    //for both backend and frontend
    npm install
    //to start both frontend and backend
    npm run dev
```
